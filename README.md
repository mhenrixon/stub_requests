This gem attempts to solve a problem I've had for the time with WebMock.

When something changes, I have to update every single stub_request.

This gem allows me to only update the crucial parts while abstracting away things like service URI's, endpoint definitions and focus on the important things.

This is achieve by keeping a registry over the service endpoints.

<a id="installation"></a>
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "stub_requests"
```

And then execute:

```
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
gem install stub_requests
```

<a id="usage"></a>
## Usage

To use the gem we need to register some service endpoints. In the following example we are connecting to a rails inspired service.

The naming of the `service_id` and `endpoint_id`'s is irrelevant. This is just how we look things up in the registry.

```ruby
StubRequests.register_service(:google_ads, "https://api.google.com/v5") do
  register(:index, :get, "ads")
  register(:show, :get, "ads/:id")
  register(:update, :patch, "ads/:id")
  register(:create, :post, "ads")
  register(:destroy, :delete, "ads/:id")
end
```

Now we have a list of endpoints we can stub.

```ruby
StubRequests.stub_endpoint(:google_ads, :index)
            .to_return(code: 204, body: "")

# This is the equivalent of doing the following in WebMock
Settings.google_ads_base_uri = "https://api.google.com/v5"

WebMock.stub_request(:get, "#{Settings.google_ads_base_uri}/ads")
       .to_return(status: 204, body: "")
```

So far so good but not much of a gain yet. The real power comes when we don't have to interpolate a bunch of URLs all the time.

```ruby
StubRequests.stub_endpoint(:google_ads, :update, id: 1) do
  with(body: request_body.to_json)
  to_return(code: 200, body: response_body.to_json)
end

# This is the equivalent of doing the following in WebMock
Settings.google_ads_base_uri = "https://api.google.com/v5"

WebMock.stub_request(:patch, "#{Settings.google_ads_base_uri}/ads/#{id}")
       .with(body: request_body.to_json)
       .to_return(status: 200, body: response_body.to_json)
```

First of all we reduce a lot of duplication.

Imagine a code base with thousands of stubbed request. You always have to look at the defined URL to understand which request is actually being called.

Madness!!

## Future Improvements

<a id="api-client-gem"></a>
### API Client Gem

Since we have a service + endpoint registry, I was thinking it might make
sense to make this into an API client. Not sure yet, maybe this will become multiple gems in the future so that someone can pick and choose.

Anyway, the idea was to provide endpoint calls in production and stubbed
requests in tests using the same registry.

<a id="debugging"></a>
### Debugging

I want to provide information about where a request stub was created from. In the project I am currently working this would have saved me a days work already.

<a id="development"></a>
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.

Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an
interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
